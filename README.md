# Stock-Price-Prediction
  In this project, I will work with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. 
We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price, 
starting with simple algorithms Linear Regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Long Term Short Memory.

The objective of the project is to perform how the algorithms work and how to predict the stock price.

  We’ll be using a dataset from www.finance.yahoo.com, 
This is the website where you can find historical data for various stocks. 
For this project I have used the data for ‘Apple Inc.’
